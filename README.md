FeatureSelectionTechniques 

I have summerise basic feature selection techiniques on this .How to choose the best features for the model build
so that we can overcome the following problems:
 .Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.
 ·Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.
 ·Reduces Training Time: fewer data points reduce algorithm complexity and algorithms train faster.
